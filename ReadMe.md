Rapid Application Development (RAD) Tools for Python GUI Development is a reliable python powered program that will give its user advantage in machine learning, Iot systems, embedded systems, and many more!

- Create your own system
- Make some scripts
- Deploy!

## Getting Started

{Under Constrction}

## Installation

1. RAD Tools for Python GUI Development requires Python3.7 to run and uses a number of python 3.7 dependencies to work properly:

        ```pip install PyQt5
        pip install QScintilla
        pip install parso==0.8.2
        pip install jedi==0.18.0
        pip install flask==1.0.4
        pip install pyserial
        pip install requests
        pip install pandas
        pip install pillow
        pip install opencv_python-4.5.2-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl		#from wheel search internet
        pip install pip install opencv-contrib-python
        pip install tensorflow==2.0					#if 64bit system
        
      ***Make sure that Python37 is in the same directory as your WiredQT folder.***

2. Compressed and download the whole WiredQt folder.
3. Extract its contents to your root directory, like so
    
        C:\WiredQt

4. Edit the batch file [WiredQT.bat] in your preferred text editor, depending on which directory you want to place python37 and WiredQt for ease of access. In my case, it is;

        path=c:\python37
        python WiredQT.py
        
5. And, you're good to go! Yay!
